Python is a high-level programming language that is easy to learn and widely used in various fields like data science, web development, artificial intelligence, and more. Here are some basic features of Python:

1. Python is an interpreted language, meaning the code is executed line by line rather than compiled beforehand.
2. Python uses whitespace indentation to indicate code blocks, making the code easy to read and write.
3. Variables in Python do not need to be explicitly declared and can change type dynamically.
4. Python supports various data types such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
5. Python has a large standard library and numerous third-party packages for various tasks such as data analysis, web development, machine learning, and more.
6. Python supports object-oriented, functional, and procedural programming paradigms.

To run a simple Python program, open a text editor and type:

```
print("Hello, World!")
```

Save the file as "hello.py" and then run the program using the command "python hello.py" in the terminal or command prompt. This will print "Hello, World!" to the screen.
