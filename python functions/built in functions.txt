Python provides a large number of built-in functions that can be used to perform common operations. Here are some examples of built-in functions:

### Print

The `print` function is used to output text or variables to the console:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

Output:

```
Hello, world!
```

### Len

The `len` function is used to get the length of a string, list, tuple, or dictionary:

```python
string = "Hello, world!"
print(len(string))  # Output: 13

list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(len(list))  # Output: 5
```

### Range

The `range` function is used to generate a sequence of numbers:

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

Output:

```
0
1
2
3
4
```

### Type

The `type` function is used to get the data type of a variable:

```python
string = "Hello, world!"
print(type(string))  # Output: <class 'str'>

list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(type(list))  # Output: <class 'list'>
```

### Max and Min

The `max` and `min` functions are used to get the maximum and minimum values in a list or tuple:

```python
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(max(list))  # Output: 5

tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
print(min(tuple))  # Output: 10
```

### Sum

The `sum` function is used to get the sum of all the numbers in a list or tuple:

```python
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(sum(list))  # Output: 15

tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
print(sum(tuple))  # Output: 150
```

These are just a few examples of the many built-in functions that Python provides.
